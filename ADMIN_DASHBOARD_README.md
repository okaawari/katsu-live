- Check file permissions on storage directory

**Scheduling Not Working**
- Ensure your server timezone is configured correctly
- Check that scheduled tasks are running (if using job queues)

### File Size Limits
If you need to upload larger files, you may need to adjust:
- `upload_max_filesize` in php.ini
- `post_max_size` in php.ini
- `max_execution_time` for large uploads

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Currently allows all authenticated users
- Recommend implementing role-based access control
- Consider adding admin-specific middleware

### File Security
- All uploads go through Laravel's validation
- Files stored in secure storage directories
- Consider implementing virus scanning for uploads
